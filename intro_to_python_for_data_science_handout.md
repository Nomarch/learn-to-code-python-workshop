# Intro to Python for Data Science

## Why are we here?
1. Intro to coding in Python
2. Intro to data science using Python
3. Intro to the Codeup experience

## What's the Codeup difference?
1. Focus on outcomes and application
2. Placement services and quality of network
3. Immersion works - live, in-person instruction for 5 months works.

### Isn't data science just another way to say statistics?
- See "50 years of data science"
- Reference Tukey 
- etc..

### 3 keys to success that students get at Codeup
1. In addition to learning data science, you'll learn how to continue learning data science into the future
2. How to form and ask effective questions, find your own answers, and collaborate in the face of uncertainty (how to get really good at googling stuff and collaborating with people)
3. How to debug and troubleshoot using the scientific methodg

### How to get the most out of this workshop
- Treat each other with excellence
- What you get out of this is a function of what you put into it
- Engage with the material, engage with others
- Ask questions
- Try things out! Run code! Experiment with the tools!

### 5 things you'll get from this workshop
1. Introduction to Python fundamentals
2. Intro to some Python data science libraries and methods
3. Instructional materials and your own copies of our prepared learning environments
4. Time to practice with the material including guidance and support on exercises
5. A clear introduction to the Codeup experience

### What we will *not* deliver today
- Excel, R, or any other statistical analysis tools
- Everything you need to know about statistics
- Everything you need to know about Python
- 5 months worth of practice, exercises, and training
- The 3-4 weeks worth of prework necessary for attending Codeup's data science program

### 2 step setup process for your learning environment
1. Create an account on `https://kaggle.com`
2. Fork the first notebook for Part I of our workshop

## Part I - Intro to Python
Fork `this` notebook to make your own copy our prepared environment for Part I.

### What is Python and why do we care?

### Using Jupyter Notebooks
- `shift + enter` to run a cell of code

### Primitive data types and examples
- 2 is an integer, -4 is an integer
- 2.3 is a float, -2.0 is a float
- "characters inside double quotes" and 'characters inside of single quotes are strings'
- True and False are boolean values
- None is a data type representing a lack of data

### Operators and the results of operations

### Assignment, reassignment, and mutation 

### Working with Sequences
- ["square", "brackets", "make", "lists"]
- tuple ()
- dictionary {}


### Functions

## Part II - intro to data science libraries/methodologies
- Fork `this` notebook for part II

normalizing? (maybe too much)


## Part III - putting things together to answer questions
- Fork `this` notebook for part III
