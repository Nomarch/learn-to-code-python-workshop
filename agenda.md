# Intro to Data Science and Python Workshop

## Thought for the Day
Mathematics, you see, is not a spectator sport.
To understand mathematics means to be able to do mathematics.
And what does it mean [to be] doing mathematics?
In the first place, it means to be able to solve mathematical problems.
- Polya
