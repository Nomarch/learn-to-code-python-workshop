# Intro to Python for Data Science

## Why are we here?
1. Intro to coding in Python
2. Intro to data science using Python
3. Intro to the Codeup experience

## Why Codeup?
1. Focus on student outcomes
2. Placement services and quality of network
3. Immersion works. Full-time, live, in-person instruction for 5 months works.

### Isn't data science just another way to say statistics?
- See "50 years of data science"
- Reference Tukey 
- etc..

### What *is* Data Science?
- The application of the scientific process of hypothesis->experiment->analyze->repeat to analyze and infer outcomes from data.
- Interdisciplinary field at the intersection of programming, business/domain expertise, and applied statistics
- A broad description of approaches ranging from business analysis and visualizations to machine learning. 

### What *isn't* Data Science?
- Only statistics or only mathematics
- Magic
- Going to get more challenging. It's only going to get more accessible and prevalent over time.

### 3 keys to success that students get at Codeup
1. In addition to learning data science, you'll learn how to continue learning data science into the future
2. How to form and ask effective questions, find your own answers, and collaborate in the face of uncertainty (how to get really good at googling stuff and collaborating with people)
3. How to debug and troubleshoot using the scientific methodg

### How to get the most out of this workshop
- Engage with the material, engage with others
- Ask questions
- What you get out of this is a function of what you put into it
- Treat each other with excellence
- Try things out! Run code! Experiment with the tools!

### 6 things you will get from today's workshop
1. A clear introduction to the Codeup experience
2. Introduction to Python fundamentals
3. Explanation of mathematical concepts in terms of Python
4. Intro to some Python data science libraries and methods
5. Instructional materials and your own copies of our prepared learning environments
6. Time to practice with the material including guidance and support on exercises

### What we will *not* deliver today
- Excel, R, or any other statistical analysis tools
- Everything you need to know about statistics
- Everything you need to know about Python
- 5 months worth of practice, exercises, and training

### 2 step setup process for your learning environment
1. Create an account on `https://kaggle.com`
2. Fork the first notebook for Part I of our workshop

## Part I - Intro to Python
Fork `this` notebook to make your own copy our prepared environment for Part I.

### What is Python and why do we care?

### Using Jupyter Notebooks
- `shift + enter` to run a cell of code

### Primitive data types and examples
- True and False are boolean values
- 2 is an integer, -4 is an integer, 0 is an integer
- 2.3 is a float, -2.0 is a float
- "characters inside double quotes" and 'characters inside of single quotes' are strings. Strings are the data type for text.
- None is a data type representing a lack of data

### Operators and the results of operations 

### Assignment, reassignment, and mutation 

### Functions
```python
def square(input):
    """ Square takes in an input and returns the square or an error if the input is not numeric"""
    return input*input
print(square(3)) # this will return 9
```

### More compound/complex data types

- ["square", "brackets", "make", "lists"]
- tuple ()
- dictionary {}
- set


## Part II - Math notation explained with Python


## Part III - intro to data science libraries/methodologies
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pydataset import data
```
