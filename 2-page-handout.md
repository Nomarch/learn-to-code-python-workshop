# Intro to Python for Data Science

## Why are we here?

1. Intro to coding in Python
2. Intro to data science using Python
3. Intro to the Codeup experience

## Why Codeup?

1. Focus on student outcomes
2. Placement services and quality of network
3. Immersion works. Full-time, live, in-person instruction for 5 months works.

### What is Data Science?

- Interdisciplinary applied science at the intersection of programming, business/domain expertise, and statistics
- The application of the scientific process of hypothesis->experiment->analyze->repeat to analyze and infer outcomes from data.
- A broad description of approaches ranging from business analysis and visualizations to machine learning and deep neural network analysis.
- An increasingly accessible field

### What *isn't* Data Science?

- Only statistics or only mathematics (Although we let the computer do the math!)
- Magic

### Isn't data science just statistics?

- See "Future of Data Analysis" by Tukey 1961, `https://bit.ly/2FsUJgf`
- See "50 years of data science" by Donoho 2015, `https://bit.ly/2Gh0Rpp`
- There's also linear algebra, calculus, and discrete math in addition to programming

### 3 keys to success that students get from Codeup

1. In addition to learning data science, you'll learn how to continue learning data science into the future
2. How to form and ask effective questions, find your own answers, and collaborate in the face of uncertainty (how to get really good at googling stuff and collaborating with people)
3. How to debug and troubleshoot using the scientific method

### 5 Ways to get the most out of this workshop

1. Engage with the material, engage with others
2. Ask questions
3. What you get out of this is a function of what you put into it
4. Treat each other with excellence
5. Try things out! Run code! Experiment with the tools!

### 6 things you will get from today's workshop

1. A clear introduction to the Codeup experience
2. Introduction to Python fundamentals
3. Explanation of mathematical concepts in terms of Python
4. Intro to some Python data science libraries and methods
5. Instructional materials and your own copies of the prepared learning environments
6. Time to practice with the material including guidance and support on exercises

### What we will *not* cover today

- Excel, R, SAS, SPSS, or any other statistical analysis tools
- Everything you need to know about Python or statistics
- 5 months worth of practice, exercises, training, and mentoring

### The five questions Data Science can answer

1. How many or how much of something? What will sales be next year?
2. Which category does this thing belong to: is this A or B?
3. What groups? Does grouping things provide additional insight? Who are our best customers?
4. Is this weird? Anomaly detection like looking for fraudulent transactions
5. What should we do next? Infer likely outcomes

### Some Data Science Methodologies

- Regression - predict housing prices
- Classification - predict customers who will churn
- Clustering - identify physical neighborhoods, identify similar species
- Time series analysis - forecast revenue, predict store item demand
- Anomaly Detection - detect fraudulent transactions, account takeovers 
- NLP - Siri, sentiment analysis, twitter bots, customer feedback
- Graph Analysis - social networks, web analytics, page rank
- Recommender Systems - netflix, amazon shopping
- Neural Networks / Deep Learning - image recognition, iPhone X face id
