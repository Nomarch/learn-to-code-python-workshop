# Learn to Code - Python for Data Science

### What and How?
- 4 hour intro workshop to python for data science. Heavier on the python, light intro to data science libraries and methods, plenty of exercises and examples
- 4 page Handout
  - Setup instructions (fork this link on kaggle to start, then fork exercise #2, etc..)
  - Data types, variables, operators, assignment, etc..
  - Sequences, collections, and operating on them
  - Jupyter notebook
- Deliver notebook(s) on kaggle for students to fork, 3 notebooks one for each section of the 4 hour workshop
- slide deck

### Deliverables for attendees: 
- 4 page handout
- Jupyter notebooks w/ lesson material, examples, and exercises
- a 3 act play (intro to python, intro to , do some analysis on `lemonade.csv`)

# What is a data scientists?
- someone who knows more stats than the software engineers
- someone who knows more software engineering than the statisticians

# 3 act play
0. Setup and expectations and deliver handout (what we're doing today, why we're here)
   (maybe) Activity == ice breaker == data collection
    - take 5 minutes to visit with a person close to you
    - Have everyone introduce their neighbor
    - collect the data on the podium and present it

1. Intro to python fundamentals w/ lots of examples
    - Lecture
    - Exercise
    - Review

2. Intro to stats and mathy bits with python & libraries
    - just enough numpy and pandas to be dangerous  
    - multiple working examples w/ descriptive stats and data manipulation
      `<br>` break for lunch

3. Walk through a larger exercise like lemonade.csv 
- how does price impact revenue?
- how does temperature impact revenue?
- how does rainfall impact revenue?
- does distributing more flyers tend to occur with more sales?
- logistic regression - If it's 100 degrees and I distribute 100 flyers, what will revenue be?

# Intro to Python using Notebooks
- Intro to data types, variables, and operators
- Show assignment, reassignment
- working with sequences and collections
    - indexing
    - slicing
    - iterating
- How to lookup the documentation or "how to do XYZ in python"
- Intro to writing your own functions

# Data Sets for the workshop
mpg.csv
lemonade.csv

## Exercises
- what's the maximum in a collection
- what's the most frequently occurring observation
- what's the least frequently occurring observation?
- what's the average?


# Math notation explained in Python
or
and
union
intersection
empty_set
is a subset of

element is a member of
element is not a member of

### Actual statistics, yo!
- descriptive statistics of lemonade.csv
- maybe visualization of lemonade.csv?
- hypothesis testing on lemonade.csv
- maybe a regression?


# Storyboard and script

## Before things officially start
- hang out and visit with people
- Handouts printed and on every seat (backup handouts ready)
- Setup instructions on display (wifi info, goto kaggle, fork this, read this)

## Kickoff or transition from Dimitri/introducer
- Introduce material
- Introduce self
- Outline the process for the day, set expectations 
  - Part I is lecture, exercise, review
  - Part II is lecture, exercise, review
  - Part III is a small project combining 

### Slides
- Welcome slide with salient info:
  - wifi network names and password
  - instructions for getting started
- The "about codeup" part should have already been covered
- About your instructor
- Ground rules
